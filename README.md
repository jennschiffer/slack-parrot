# Slack Parrot
This project demonstrates how to build an app using Slack's Events API by repeating any message entered into a channel - a good base for more sophisticated bots that listen in on the conversation :) Please only use for good!


## Getting Started
To get started you need to:
- Set up your Slack App in Slack - Find more detailed setup instructions in `setup.md`.
- Invite the bot user to a channel where you want it to work
- Customize the index/landing page html in `tinyspeck.js` around line 20
- To change what the "parrot" messages, update `index.js`
