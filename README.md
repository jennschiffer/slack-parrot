# Slack Parrot
This project demonstrates how to build an app using Slack's Events API by repeating any message entered into a channel - a good base for more sophisticated bots that listen in on the conversation :) Please only use for good.


## Getting Started
To get started you need to:
- Set up your Slack App in Slack
- Copy across the Slack API tokens into the `.env` file
- the index/landing page html is generated in `tinyspeck.js` around line 20

For more detailed setup instructions, see `setup.md`.
